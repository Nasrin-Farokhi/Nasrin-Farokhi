🎓 The candidate earned a master's degree in Forest Ecology and Silviculture, with research focused on the morphological and physiological responses of Populus deltoides clones under drought stress. The thesis received a score of 19.38/20 (the second-highest in the department) and led to the publication of two conference papers in Persian and one peer-reviewed journal article.

🔬 Although the thesis analyses were based on one-way and two-way ANOVA using SPSS, structured training in R programming has recently been pursued, with an emphasis on ecological modelling and data analysis.

## 📂 Featured Projects

- [`R-learning-notes`](https://github.com/Nasrin-Farokhi/R-learning-notes)  
  A collection of structured R programming notes and scripts tailored to applications in forest science.

### 🔧 Upcoming repositories:

- `Species-Distribution-Modelling` — modelling range shifts of species under climate change  
- `Populus-Drought-Analysis` — presents statistical outcomes and key insights from a master's thesis on drought stress in Populus deltoides clones, featuring visualizations and results published in a peer-reviewed article.

## 🌍 Motivation

As climate change accelerates, forest ecosystems are facing increasingly frequent droughts, rising temperatures, and disrupted phenological cycles. These shifts demand ecological research that is both predictive and spatially informed. Traditional tools alone are no longer enough to assess the dynamic responses of species to environmental change.

Training in species distribution modelling and spatial data analysis has strengthened R programming expertise — a powerful tool for modelling complex ecological phenomena — enabling more precise, reproducible, and data-driven approaches to forest research.

This GitHub profile showcases key milestones in ecological programming and encourages collaboration within the forest science community.
