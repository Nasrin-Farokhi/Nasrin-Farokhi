🎓 I hold a master's degree in Forest Ecology and Silviculture. My M.Sc. research focused on the morphological and physiological responses of *Populus deltoides* clones under drought stress. I earned a thesis score of **19.38/20**, the second-highest in my department, and published two Persian conference papers and one peer-reviewed journal article.

🔬 While my thesis analyses were based on one-way and two-way ANOVA using SPSS, in recent years I have pursued structured training in R programming, with a focus on ecological modeling and data analysis.

## 📂 Featured Projects

- [`R-learning-notes`](https://github.com/Nasrin-Farokhi/R-learning-notes)  
  Step-by-step notes and scripts from my R programming journey, with applications in forest science.

### 🔧 Upcoming repositories:

- `Species-Distribution-Modeling` — modeling range shifts of species under climate change  
- `Populus-Drought-Analysis` — sharing statistical results and key figures from my thesis on drought stress in *Populus deltoides* clones, including visualizations and findings from the published article

## 🌍 Motivation

As climate change accelerates, forest ecosystems are facing more frequent droughts, rising temperatures, and disrupted phenology. These shifts demand ecological research that is both predictive and spatially informed. Traditional tools alone are no longer enough to assess the dynamic responses of species to environmental change.

In response to this need, I have expanded my skills in **R programming** — a powerful tool for modeling complex ecological phenomena. From species distribution models to spatial data analysis, my training has helped me approach forest research with precision, reproducibility, and data-driven insight.

Through this GitHub profile, I aim to share highlights from this scientific journey in ecological programming and invite others in forest science to connect and collaborate.
